# Tic-tac-toe

X's and O'x - 3 in a row.

## Bugs to resolve

- computer score is not incrementing by 1 upon adding score (currently incrementing by 5 or more)

## Future Development

- better styling - colors, player/computer sections, gameboard, clear button
- input for username
- indications for color (user selection is shown in one, computer in another)
  -- bonus - adding a color picker for this purpose
- light/dark theme toggle
- clean up Javascript - organize functions and variables into [modules/factory functions](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-factory-functions-and-the-module-pattern)
